## Test Commands Available

```bash
# Test database directly
npm run db:test

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test API endpoints (with server running):
curl http://localhost:3000/api/categories
curl http://localhost:3000/api/playlists?category=made-for-you
curl http://localhost:3000/api/playlists?category=popular-albums
```

## Component Integration

The `SpotifyMainContent` component now:
1. Fetches data from API endpoints using `usePlaylists` hook
2. Shows loading states with skeleton placeholders
3. Displays error messages if API calls fail
4. Renders real data from database instead of static arrays
5. Maintains all original UI/UX behavior

## Next Steps

The database integration is complete and ready for use. The component will now display data from the database, and you can:

1. Add new playlists via API
2. Filter by category
3. Extend with additional fields
4. Add search functionality
5. Implement user-specific playlists
