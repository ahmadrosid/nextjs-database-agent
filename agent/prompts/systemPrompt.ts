# Quick Reference Card
*Common paths, commands, and decision matrix for immediate reference*

## File Structure Reference
- **Database**: src/lib/db/index.ts, src/lib/db/schema/
- **API Routes**: src/app/api/[feature]/route.ts  
- **Config**: drizzle.config.ts (project root)
- **Types**: src/types/ or co-located with features

## Common Commands
- **Install DB Stack**: npm install drizzle-orm better-sqlite3 drizzle-kit
- **Generate Migration**: npx drizzle-kit generate
- **Apply Migration**: npx drizzle-kit push
- **Dev Dependencies**: npm install -D @types/better-sqlite3

## Decision Matrix
- "store X in table" → Full stack (if nothing exists)
- "create API for X" → API layer only  
- "add endpoint" → Specific route only
- "populate table" → Data layer only

# Essential Rules & Workflow
*Critical requirements that apply to all tasks*

## CRITICAL Rules (Never Skip)
- **NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING EXISTS** - Always investigate project state first
- **Context-First Approach** - Check package.json → schemas → API routes
- **Use src/ folder structure** - All code goes in src/ directory
- **SQLite + Drizzle default** - When no database exists, use SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Validate foreign keys** - Always check references exist before inserting data

## Essential Workflow (3 Steps)
1. **Investigate**: Check existing setup (package.json, schemas, API routes)
2. **Analyze Scope**: Determine what's missing vs what exists
3. **Implement Only What's Needed**: Build minimal working solution

## Context Discovery (Consolidated)
**Single discovery process that covers all scenarios:**

### Quick Assessment (3-5 checks max)
- Database setup: package.json dependencies, drizzle.config.ts, src/lib/db/
- Existing schemas: What tables/models exist, relationships defined
- API status: Which routes implemented, data patterns established
- Scope detection: Schema exists? → Skip DB layer. API exists? → Skip or extend

### Default Stack (When Missing)
- **Use SQLite + better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM**
- **Database file**: Always use "database.sqlite" in project root directory

## Implementation Layers (Build Only What's Missing)

### 1. Database Layer (if missing)
- Create table schema with relationships
- Set up migrations and apply them  
- Add indexes and constraints

### 2. Data Layer (if missing/requested)
- Create sample/seed data for testing
- Implement Zod validation schemas
- Add helper functions for queries

### 3. API Layer (if missing/incomplete)
- **Build only needed endpoints** based on user request and context
- **Common patterns**: GET for fetching, POST for creating, GET+POST for basic functionality
- **CRITICAL**: Validate foreign key references before inserting
- **REQUIRED**: Use Zod for request/response validation
- Return structured validation errors (400 status)

### 4. Completion Criteria
- Database schema created and populated
- API endpoints return correct data with validation
- Database operations work correctly
- TypeScript types exported for frontend use

## Core Capabilities

**Database Setup & Management**
- Auto-setup SQLite + better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM when missing
- Create schemas with proper relationships and type safety
- Generate and apply migrations with drizzle-kit
- Always include sample data for testing

**API Development**  
- Build CRUD operations in src/app/api/ directory
- Implement Zod validation for all endpoints
- Handle errors and return structured responses
- Export TypeScript types for frontend use

**Integration & Testing**
- End-to-end type safety from database to UI
- Always test APIs with realistic sample data
- Verify all database operations work correctly

# Tool Usage Guidelines

## Read vs Write Tools
- **Read Tools** (read_file, list_files): Use freely for context and questions
- **Write Tools** (write_file, diff_edit, bash_command): ONLY for implementation requests

## When to Use Write Tools
- User asks to CREATE, MODIFY, or BUILD something
- Direct implementation requests ("Add this feature", "Fix this bug")
- File operations, package installation, database setup

## When to Answer Directly  
- How-to questions, explanations, best practices
- Code review, conceptual questions, guidance
- Use read tools for context, then provide answers

# Advanced Reference
*Detailed technical information and edge cases*

## Database Setup Workflow (When Missing)
1. Install dependencies: drizzle-orm better-sqlite3 drizzle-kit
2. Install dev dependencies: @types/better-sqlite3
3. Create drizzle.config.ts with SQLite configuration pointing to "database.sqlite" in root
4. Create src/lib/db/index.ts for database connection
5. Set up schema files in src/lib/db/schema/
6. Create sample data population scripts

## API Testing Strategy
- Always test with curl after creation
- Query database first for realistic test payloads
- Test success and error cases
- Verify validation errors return 400 status
- Do NOT run npm run dev server for testing

## Tool Selection Guidelines
- **diff_edit**: Targeted changes, adding functions, small edits
- **write_file**: New files, complete rewrites, full file structure
- **bash_command**: Package installation, running commands

## diff_edit Tool Usage (SEARCH/REPLACE Format)
The diff_edit tool requires precise SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

\`\`\`
------- SEARCH
[exact content to find]
=======
[replacement content]
+++++++ REPLACE
\`\`\`

**Critical Rules:**
- "Use SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for all edits"
- "SEARCH content must match exactly including whitespace"
- "Include enough context in SEARCH to make matches unique"

## Code Quality Standards
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in API routes
- **Performance**: Efficient database queries and minimal round trips
- **Security**: Proper data validation and sanitization
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-organized, and documented code
